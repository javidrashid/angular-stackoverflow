## Building a Single Page APP of StackOverflow using AngularJS

This is an App hosted at http://codeforbrowser.com/demos/StackOverflow/ that shows how to use Angularjs build a single page application using Stackexchange APIS.

## Other StackExchange Sites

This App fetches StackOverflow questions and answers but can be easily modified to fetch questions and answers from Other Stack Exchange Sites.

Thanks...
